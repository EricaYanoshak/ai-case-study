# AI USE CASE

## Overview and Origin

* Company: **Japer.AI**

[website](https://www.jasper.ai/)

* Founded in 2021 by Dave Rogenmoser, Chris Hull, and John Phillip Morgan, Jasper.AI is a AI and SaaS-based platform for content creation and has been recognized as "one of America's fastest-growing private companies" by Inc. 5000.

* Being marketers themselves, the three founders experienced the pains of constantly having to keep up with the excessive content demands and hardships of creating enough testing variations to produce valuable market insights. When they came across generative AI in 2020, the idea for Jasper.AI was born. What started as a way for marketers to create and test ad variations, quickly turned into the creation of long-form content and expanded into the AI content creation platform we know today.

* Jasper AI has raised a total of $143 million in funding over two rounds. The most recent round was a Series A round on May 27, 2022, led by Insight Partners, for $141 million. Other investors in this round include Coatue, Bessemer Venture Partners, IVP, Foundation Capital, Founders Circle Capital, and HubSpot Ventures.


## Business Activities

* **Specific problem company is working to solve:** Built for marketers by marketers, the founders of Jasper.AI know how difficult it is for executives and content teams to keep up with the increasing content demand. Companies today need to maintain a presence across multiple channels, including blogs, podcasts, newsletters, and various social media platforms. This puts immense pressure on marketing teams, often leading to rushed and lower-quality output as teams prioritize meeting word counts and deadlines over quality. Jasper.AI aims to alleviate this content creation burden by leveraging generative AI to accelerate the writing process. By doing so, Jasper.AI works to provide content teams with more breathing room and time to develop high-quality ideas without being overwhelmed by the sheer volume of content across multiple platforms.

* **Intended customer:** Executives, content and marketing teams at growing companies

* **Market size of customers:** Jasper.AI has a diverse user base, with the majority of users falling into the age group of 25-34. Males make up 60% and females make up 40%. Furthermore, 40% of Jasper.AI users are marketers; 20% are content creators; 15% are students; 10% are business owners; and 15% fall into the other category.  

* **Unfair advantage:** Jasper.AI's unfair advantage lies in its ability to tailor their AI to a brand's unique voice and style guide, a solution competitors have yet to match. By training on a company's specific brand voice and style guidelines, Jasper.AI ensures that all generated content seamlessly aligns with the brand's distinct identity, saving marketers and businesses valuable time and resources that would otherwise be spent enforcing brand consistency. While the market offers other AI writing tools, none can rival Jasper.AI's level of customization and tailored solutions, which allow for the creation of genuinely on-brand content at scale. 

* **Technologies utilized:** Jasper.AI is based on the open-source GPT-3 API, which powers over 300 applications, including most of its competitors


## Landscape

* **Field:** AI writing industry

* **Trends and innovations:** The AI writing industry has witnessed several major trends and innovations over the past 5-10 years that have transformed the way content is created and delivered. Notable developments: include: advancements in Natural Language Processing and Language Models; customizable AI writing solutions for brands and businesses; integrations with content management systems; and multilingual content generation.

* **Competitors:** ChatGPT, Copy.ai, and Writesonic


## Results

* **Business impact:**  Jasper.AI's innovative AI writing solutions have disrupted the content creation landscape, enabling businesses to achieve higher productivity, cost savings, brand consistency, and scalability. According to Statista, Jasper.AI holds approximately 30% of the market share in the AI writing industry. In the comparison of Jasper.AI with other AI writing assistants, Jasper.AI stands out not only for its unique ability to be trained on individual companies' brand voices and style of writing, but also for its comprehensive features, ease of use, and advanced AI technology. 


## Recommendations

* Users of Jasper.AI may benefit from being able to train Jasper.AI with their custom business data. While Jasper.AI does analyze existing writing using the Brand Voice feature to tune the AI’s style closer to the users, there is currently no direct custom model training.

* Frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch can be used to build custom models.

* Providing users with the ability to develop their custom AI models could benefit Jasper.AI by increasing their income stream, as many businesses may be interested given the custom AI model will always be superior to the services of an off-the-shelf model as well as provide increased data security.
